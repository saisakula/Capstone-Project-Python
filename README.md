# MCQ Based Online Exam Application

## Overview
This project consists of two Python scripts, `question_master.py` and 
`exam_client.py`, designed to manage and take multiple-choice questions (MCQ) 
exams. The questions are stored in a CSV file named `questions.csv`.

- **`question_master.py`**: Allows administrators to add, search, delete, modify, and 
display questions.
- **`exam_client.py`**: Allows students to take the exam and see their results.

## Files
- **`questions.csv`**: The file where questions are stored in the following format:

      num,question,option1,option2,option3,option4,correctoption
      1,10+20 ans is,10,30,40,10,2
      2,20-10 ans is,20,30,40,10,4
      3,2*2 ans is,4,5,6,7,1

      python exam_client.py


Workflow
	1.	Displays the current date and time.
	2.	Prompts the student to enter their name and university.
	3.	Displays each question with options and prompts the student to enter 
their choice.
	4.	At the end of the test, displays the student's name, university, and score.

## Example

When the script is run, the following sample screen is displayed:

Display
Today's date and time: 15/Sep/2024 12.46.30

Enter student name    : *****
Enter university      : cisco

1) 10+20 is equal what?

## Logging

Both scripts use logging to record informational messages and errors. The logs provide a 
record of events and can help in troubleshooting issues.
Exception Handling


The scripts are designed to handle exceptions gracefully. For instance, if the 
questions.csv file is not found, an appropriate error message is logged.
